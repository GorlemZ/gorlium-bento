        "Terrariums, I learned, are about balanceâ€”and soil is at the heart of that. It's not just dirt; it's the foundation for everything. The right mixture creates the environment where plants can grow, water can circulate, and the whole ecosystem can thrive.",
        "Take this terrarium in the picture, for example. It's âœ¨preciousâœ¨ to me because it holds pebbles and a snail shell from my [now lost] childhood home. I refused to give up on it after my initial failures.",
        "Attempt One lasted three weeks. Mold everywhere, rotting fittonia, and stagnant water pooling at the bottom",
        "Attempt Two failed almost immediately, after few days the colors and balance were all wrong.",
        "Attempt Three? It thrived for five years before needing a refreshâ€”and it's still alive and well today ðŸ’š.",
        " The secret? A lot of trial and errorâ€”and discovering how much the right soil matters. Good soil doesn't just anchor the plants; it helps regulate water, prevents mold, and provides the nutrients needed for long-term health. A terrarium isn't just a pretty jar; it's an ecosystem. Get the soil mixture right, and the rest falls into place."

        "This last batch I made in autumn 2024 is currently surviving the harsh conditions of my terribly exposed office window (a true test of resilience). They just stretched a little bit, ready to be trimmed in springtime. ðŸŒ±"
