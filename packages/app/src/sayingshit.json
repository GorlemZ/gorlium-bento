        "Terrariums, I learned, are about balance‚Äîand soil is at the heart of that. It's not just dirt; it's the foundation for everything. The right mixture creates the environment where plants can grow, water can circulate, and the whole ecosystem can thrive.",
        "Take this terrarium in the picture, for example. It's ‚ú®precious‚ú® to me because it holds pebbles and a snail shell from my [now lost] childhood home. I refused to give up on it after my initial failures.",
        "Attempt One lasted three weeks. Mold everywhere, rotting fittonia, and stagnant water pooling at the bottom",
        "Attempt Two failed almost immediately, after few days the colors and balance were all wrong.",
        "Attempt Three? It thrived for five years before needing a refresh‚Äîand it's still alive and well today üíö.",
        " The secret? A lot of trial and error‚Äîand discovering how much the right soil matters. Good soil doesn't just anchor the plants; it helps regulate water, prevents mold, and provides the nutrients needed for long-term health. A terrarium isn't just a pretty jar; it's an ecosystem. Get the soil mixture right, and the rest falls into place."

        "During the darker, colder months, plants have less energy due to reduced sunlight and slower growth, making it harder for them to establish strong roots. In the spring there's usually enough sunlight to support a healthy rooting process and I can ensure the plants thrive in their new environment.",
        "Also, working in the cold to create terrariums isn't ideal for me either: I'm too lazy to work inside under artificial light and then clean everything up while my cats try to scatter the materials all over the house.",
